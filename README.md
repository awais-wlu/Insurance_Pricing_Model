## Project Summary for Recruiters

This project showcases an insurance pricing model built in R to predict insurance premiums based on customer and policy data. It demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, and model evaluation skills relevant to actuarial science, finance, and data analytics. The project highlights the ability to work with real-world datasets, build predictive models, and communicate insights effectively.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for insurance premiums using regression techniques and feature engineering. The model provides insights into pricing strategies and demonstrates the application of statistical and data analytics methods in an insurance context.

## Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized insurance customer data including:

- Age, gender, and location of policyholders
- Type of insurance coverage
- Claim history and frequency
- Policy premium amounts

All sensitive information is anonymized, and the dataset is used solely for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, correct data types, and prepare data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new variables to improve model performance and capture important relationships.
- **Modeling:** Build regression models (linear regression and regularized regression) to predict insurance premiums.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- **Visualization:** Generate plots to explore data distributions, relationships, and model performance.
